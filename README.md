# E-Commerce platform

## About

Real-time E-commerce web application, inspired by the Nike store. Through this project, I wanted to better understand Frontend-Backend communication using REST API and connect asynchronous data with UI. The application allows the user to experience the full purchasing process - from browsing products to placing an order.

## Key Features

- Token-based user authentication
- Fetching and displaying product data stored in the cloud NoSQL database.
- Displaying selected product categories
- Sorting products
- Adding new products to the store using the administration panel.
- Adding items to cart.
- Adding items to favorites.
- Simulation of the product ordering process, including a summary, selection of payment method and delivery address.
