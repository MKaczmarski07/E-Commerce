# E-Commerce platform

⚠️ Still in development

## About

Full-stack online store application, inspired by the Nike store. Through this project, I wanted to better understand Frontend-Backend communication using REST API and connect asynchronous data with UI. The application allows the user to experience the full purchasing process - from browsing products to placing an order. The interface has been carefully adapted to all types of devices, which is especially important in the case of E-Commerce applications.
