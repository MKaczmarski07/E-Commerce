# About The Project
The following project is a real-time E-commerce web application, implemented with Angular & Firebase Cloud. 
The application allows users to experience the full purchasing process - from browsing products to placing an order.

### Learning Objectives
- Through this project, I wanted to better understand Frontend-Backend communication using REST API and connect asynchronous data with UI. <br/>
- The majority of code focuses on Frontend side of the application, while backend features are handled by Firebase. <br/>
- Apart from the Angular, the project heavily utilizes RxJS library and Observer Pattern. <br/>
- User interface is optimized for all types of devices. <br/>
